    "Due to concerns over the effectiveness of their model (this reasoning bears questioning), they have only released a smaller version (117M parameters vs 1.5B parameters) of their larger model. See their reasoning [here](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/#releasestrategy). They also did not release any of the training software they used to produce the full GPT-2 model.\n",

    "Data__: Their original model was trained on a corpus of 8 million webpages (40GB of text) scraped from outgoing reddit links with Karma > 3. This if a form of human/collaborative filtering, and supposed indicator of \"quality\" of the outgoing links. See their data curation approach [here](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/#fn1).  \n",
